4. **`tests/unit/evaluator/evaluator.test.ts`** - 36 tests
   - AST evaluation
   - All node types (value, reference, range, function, operators, arrays)
   - Type coercion
   - Error propagation
   - Named expressions

5. **`tests/integration/evaluator-integration.test.ts`** - 30 tests

## Key Test Scenarios Covered:

### Error Handling
- All Excel error types (#DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #REF!, etc.)
- Error propagation through formulas
- Error recovery strategies

### Array Operations
- NumPy-style broadcasting
- Element-wise operations
- Array filtering and reduction
- Proper handling of empty arrays

### Formula Evaluation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Cell and range references
- Function calls with validation
- Array formulas
- Named expressions
- Complex nested formulas

### Integration Testing
- Parser → Evaluator → Result pipeline
- Real-world formula scenarios
- Excel compatibility behaviors
- Dependency tracking verification

## Test Execution Results:

```
✓ 205 tests passed
✗ 0 tests failed
449 expect() calls
Execution time: ~30ms
```

## Code Coverage Highlights:

The tests provide comprehensive coverage of:
- All evaluator public APIs
- Error edge cases
- Array broadcasting scenarios
- Dependency graph operations
- Type coercion rules
- Formula parsing integration

## Next Steps for Testing:

1. **Performance Tests**: Add benchmarks for large dependency graphs
2. **Stress Tests**: Test with deeply nested formulas and large arrays
3. **Function Library Tests**: As more functions are implemented
4. **Engine Integration Tests**: Once evaluator is integrated with core engine

The evaluator components are now thoroughly tested and ready for integration with the FormulaEngine!
