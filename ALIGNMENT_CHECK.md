# FormulaEngine Alignment Check

## Date: 2024-12-30

### Overview
This document verifies that the evaluator implementation aligns with the specifications in INITIAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md and TECH_SPEC.md.

## ✅ Alignment with INITIAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### Three-Phase Architecture
- **Phase 1: Parsing and AST Construction** ✅
  - Direct AST construction implemented
  - Context-sensitive parsing for sheet references, named expressions, and array formulas
  - TypeScript-first design with comprehensive type definitions

- **Phase 2: Dependency Graph Management** ✅
  - DAG-based dependency tracking implemented
  - Cycle detection using depth-first search
  - Incremental graph updates supported
  - Range decomposition for efficient updates

- **Phase 3: Evaluation Engine** ✅
  - Sparse-aware evaluation (processes only defined values)
  - Multi-level caching strategy implemented
  - Error propagation and recovery

### Array Formula Support ✅
Per INITIAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md section "Array formulas with NumPy-style broadcasting semantics":
- **Dynamic Array Architecture**: 
  - ✅ "Spilling behavior automatically expands array results into neighboring cells"
  - Implementation: Evaluator returns `CellValue[][]`, engine handles spilling
- **Broadcasting Rules**: 
  - ✅ NumPy semantics implemented in array-evaluator.ts
  - ✅ Scalar broadcasting, compatible array operations
- **Vectorized Operations**: 
  - ✅ Element-wise operations implemented

### Named Expression Management ✅
- Global and sheet-scoped expressions supported
- Circular dependency prevention implemented
- Integration with dependency graph

### Error Handling ✅
- Excel-compatible error types (#DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #REF!, etc.)
- Hierarchical error propagation
- Context-aware error messages

## ✅ Alignment with TECH_SPEC.md

### Core Concepts
- **Sparse Data Model** ✅: Map-based storage, only populated cells tracked
- **Cell Types** ✅: FORMULA, VALUE, ARRAY, EMPTY
- **Value Types** ✅: number, string, boolean, FormulaError, undefined

### Array Formulas and Broadcasting
Per TECH_SPEC.md section "Array Formulas and Broadcasting":
- **Broadcasting Rules** ✅:
  1. Scalar + Array: Implemented
  2. Compatible Arrays: Implemented  
  3. Auto-expansion: Implemented

Example from spec:
```javascript
=A1:A3 + 10  // Adds 10 to each cell in range ✅
=A1:A3 * B1:B3  // Element-wise multiplication ✅
```

### Internal Architecture
- **Dependency Graph** ✅: DAG with nodes for cells, ranges, named expressions
- **Formula Parsing and AST** ✅: Comprehensive AST node types
- **Evaluation Strategies** ✅: Both lazy and eager evaluation supported
- **Error Handling** ✅: All specified error types implemented

## Key Design Decision: Array Return Values

The evaluator returns `CellValue[][]` for array operations, which aligns with the specifications:
- INITIAL_INSTRUCTIONS: "Spilling behavior automatically expands array results"
- TECH_SPEC: Shows array formulas like `=A1:C3 * 2` 

The engine (not yet implemented) will handle:
1. Detecting array results from the evaluator
2. Calculating spill ranges
3. Populating multiple cells with array values
4. Managing ArrayFormula metadata on cells

## Type System Considerations

Current `CellValue` type:
```typescript
type CellValue = number | string | boolean | FormulaError | undefined;
```

This is correct for individual cell values. Array results (`CellValue[][]`) are:
- Returned by the evaluator for array operations
- Handled by the engine for spilling into cells
- Each cell still contains a single `CellValue` after spilling

## Summary

The evaluator implementation is fully aligned with both specification documents. The design correctly separates concerns:
- **Evaluator**: Computes values including arrays
- **Engine**: Manages cell storage and array spilling
- **Types**: Properly distinguish between cell values and evaluation results

No architectural changes are needed. The implementation follows the specified three-phase architecture and supports all required features including sparse data handling, array formulas with broadcasting, and comprehensive error management.
