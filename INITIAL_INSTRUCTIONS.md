# FormulaEngine: Comprehensive Technical Specification for TypeScript Formula Engine Library

## Executive Summary

This technical specification outlines the architecture, implementation patterns, and design principles for building **FormulaEngine**, a high-performance, TypeScript-based formula engine library similar to HyperFormula. The specification synthesizes insights from leading implementations including HyperFormula, EtherCalc, Apache POI, and academic research to create a state-of-the-art sparse-aware formula engine with array formula support and broadcasting semantics.

**FormulaEngine** will be a headless, extensible calculation engine designed for modern web applications requiring sophisticated spreadsheet-like computational capabilities. The library prioritizes Excel compatibility, performance optimization, and developer experience through TypeScript's advanced type system.

## Core Architecture and Design Principles

### Three-phase processing model optimizes performance and maintainability

FormulaEngine adopts HyperFormula's proven three-phase architecture with significant enhancements for sparse data handling and array operations:

**Phase 1: Parsing and AST Construction**
- **Chevrotain-based parser** provides superior performance over traditional parser generators while maintaining flexibility for complex formula syntax
- **Direct AST construction** during parsing eliminates intermediate representations and reduces memory overhead
- **Relative addressing optimization** stores formulas using relative cell references (`[0][+3] + [+1][-1]`) to enable AST reuse and reduce memory consumption by up to 70%
- **Context-sensitive parsing** handles complex scenarios including sheet references, named expressions, and array formulas

**Phase 2: Dependency Graph Management**
- **Optimized dependency tracking** uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with range decomposition to avoid O(n²) complexity patterns
- **Associative operation optimization** transforms range operations like `SUM(A1:A100)` into incremental calculations `B1=A1, B2=B1+A2, B3=B2+A3` reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCC) analysis** for efficient circular reference detection using Tarjan's algorithm
- **Incremental graph updates** maintain dependency relationships efficiently during sheet modifications

**Phase 3: Evaluation Engine**
- **Sparse-aware evaluation** processes only non-empty cells, providing dramatic performance improvements for typical spreadsheets (which use <1% of theoretical capacity)
- **Hybrid lazy/eager evaluation** strategy optimizes for both immediate results and computation efficiency
- **Multi-level caching** includes AST caching, computed value caching, and intermediate result memoization

### TypeScript-first design leverages advanced type system features

**Progressive Type Safety:**
```typescript
// FormulaEngine core interface with progressive building
interface FormulaEngineBuilder<TState = {}> {
  addSheet<K extends string>(name: K): FormulaEngineBuilder<TState & Record<K, Sheet>>;
  setCell(address: CellAddress, value: CellValue): FormulaEngineBuilder<TState>;
  build(): FormulaEngine<TState>;
}

// Type-safe cell addressing
interface CellAddress {
  readonly sheet: number | string;
  readonly row: number;
  readonly col: number;
}

// Union type for all possible cell values
type CellValue = number | string | boolean | FormulaError | undefined;
```

## Advanced Features Implementation

### Array formulas with NumPy-style broadcasting semantics

**Dynamic Array Architecture:**
- **Spilling behavior** automatically expands array results into neighboring cells with conflict detection
- **Broadcasting rules** follow NumPy semantics: smaller arrays are padded with repetitions, 1×n arrays expand to match output dimensions
- **Vectorized operations** apply scalar functions element-wise to arrays for optimal performance

**Matrix Operations Implementation:**
- **MMULT function** supports matrix multiplication with proper dimension validation and error handling
- **Element-wise operations** handle broadcasting for operations like `A1:A3 * B1:B3` and `A1:A3 * B1`
- **Memory-efficient matrix storage** uses sparse representations for large matrices with limited non-zero elements

**Array Formula Evaluation Algorithm:**
```typescript
class ArrayFormulaEvaluator {
  evaluate(formula: ArrayFormula): ArrayResult {
    // 1. Dimension analysis and compatibility checking
    const dimensions = this.analyzeDimensions(formula.operands);
    
    // 2. Broadcasting application using NumPy rules
    const broadcasted = this.applyBroadcasting(formula.operands, dimensions);
    
    // 3. Vectorized function application
    const result = this.vectorizeOperation(formula.operation, broadcasted);
    
    // 4. Spill range validation and result population
    return this.populateSpillRange(result, formula.outputRange);
  }
}
```

### Named expression management with sophisticated scoping

**Hierarchical Scope Resolution:**
- **Global workbook scope** for names accessible across all worksheets
- **Local worksheet scope** with override capabilities for sheet-specific names
- **Priority-based resolution** algorithm: local names override global names within their scope

**Circular Dependency Prevention:**
- **Real-time validation** prevents creation of names that would create circular references
- **Dependency graph integration** treats named expressions as first-class nodes in the dependency system

### Reference handling with intelligent copy/paste mechanics

**Reference Transformation Algorithm:**
```typescript
interface ReferenceTransformer {
  transformReferences(
    formula: string,
    sourceAddress: CellAddress,
    targetAddress: CellAddress
  ): string;
}

// Handles relative ($A1), absolute ($A$1), and mixed (A$1, $A1) references
class SmartReferenceTransformer implements ReferenceTransformer {
  transformReferences(formula: string, source: CellAddress, target: CellAddress): string {
    const offset = this.calculateOffset(source, target);
    return this.parseAndTransform(formula, offset);
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization Architecture

### Sparse-aware evaluation strategies provide dramatic performance improvements

**Sparse Data Structures:**
- **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** format for row-oriented operations with O(1) row access
- **Dictionary of Keys (DOK)** using hash maps for random access and efficient modifications
- **Adaptive storage** switches between dense and sparse representations based on data density

**Only Non-Empty Cell Processing:**
- **Used range tracking** limits computation boundaries to actual data regions
- **Smart range operations** skip empty cells entirely rather than checking and ignoring them
- **Memory overhead reduction** stores only non-zero/non-empty values with coordinate indexing

### Multi-level caching and memoization strategies

**Comprehensive Caching Architecture:**
```typescript
class FormulaEngineCache {
  // AST-level caching for formula reuse
  private astCache = new LRUCache<string, ASTNode>(1000);
  
  // Result caching for expensive calculations
  private resultCache = new LRUCache<string, CellValue>(5000);
  
  // Function-specific memoization
  private functionCache = new WeakMap<Function, Map<string, any>>();
  
  // Dependency-aware invalidation
  invalidateDependencies(address: CellAddress): void {
    const dependents = this.dependencyGraph.getDependents(address);
    dependents.forEach(dep => this.resultCache.delete(this.addressToKey(dep)));
  }
}
```

**Memory Optimization Patterns:**
- **Object pooling** for frequently allocated temporary objects
- **String interning** for repeated text values and formula patterns
- **Garbage collection optimization** using generational collection strategies

### Incremental computation with intelligent recalculation

**Change Propagation System:**
- **Dirty cell tracking** marks affected cells when dependencies change
- **Topological sort optimization** pre-computes calculation order for efficiency
- **Batch update support** processes multiple changes efficiently to minimize recalculation overhead

## TypeScript Implementation Patterns

### Plugin architecture with type-safe extensibility

**Core Plugin Interface:**
```typescript
interface FormulaPlugin {
  name: string;
  functions: Record<string, FormulaFunction>;
  initialize(engine: FormulaEngine): void;
}

// Type-safe function registration
interface FunctionDefinition<TArgs extends unknown[] = unknown[], TReturn = unknown> {
  name: string;
  args: readonly [...TArgs];
  returnType: TReturn;
  execute: (...args: TArgs) => TReturn;
  validate?: (args: TArgs) => boolean;
}

class FunctionRegistry {
  register<TArgs extends unknown[], TReturn>(
    definition: FunctionDefinition<TArgs, TReturn>
  ): void {
    this.functions.set(definition.name, definition);
  }
}
```

**Extensible Architecture Benefits:**
- **Compile-time type safety** for all plugin interactions
- **Runtime validation** with comprehensive error reporting
- **Hot-swappable plugins** for dynamic functionality updates

### Advanced error handling with Result patterns

**Type-Safe Error Management:**
```typescript
type Result<T, E = Error> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

class FormulaEvaluator {
  evaluate(formula: string): Result<CellValue, FormulaError> {
    try {
      const result = this.parseAndEvaluate(formula);
      return { success: true, data: result };
    } catch (error) {
      return { 
        success: false, 
        error: new FormulaError(error.message, formula) 
      };
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Propagation Architecture:**
- **Hierarchical error types** with specific error codes (#REF!, #VALUE!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- **Error recovery mechanisms** using IFERROR and similar functions
- **Contextual error reporting** with formula location and dependency information

### Undo/redo implementation with command patterns

**Type-Safe Command System:**
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): CommandResult;
  undo(): CommandResult;
  redo(): CommandResult;
}

class UpdateCellCommand implements Command {
  constructor(
    private address: CellAddress,
    private newValue: CellValue,
    private oldValue?: CellValue
  ) {}
  
  execute(): CommandResult {
    this.oldValue = this.engine.getCellValue(this.address);
    this.engine.setCellValue(this.address, this.newValue);
    return { success: true, canUndo: true };
  }
  
  undo(): CommandResult {
    this.engine.setCellValue(this.address, this.oldValue);
    return { success: true, canRedo: true };
  }
}
```

## API Design and Developer Experience

### Fluent interface design following modern TypeScript patterns

**Progressive API Building:**
```typescript
const engine = FormulaEngine.create()
  .addSheet('Calculator')
  .setCell({ sheet: 0, row: 0, col: 0 }, '=SUM(A2:A10)')
  .addNamedExpression('TaxRate', '0.08')
  .build();
```

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
```typescript
interface FormulaEngineEvents {
  'cell-changed': { address: CellAddress; oldValue: CellValue; newValue: CellValue };
  'formula-calculated': { formula: string; result: CellValue };
  'dependency-updated': { dependents: CellAddress[] };
}

class FormulaEngine extends TypedEventEmitter<FormulaEngineEvents> {
  setCellValue(address: CellAddress, value: CellValue): void {
    const oldValue = this.getCellValue(address);
    // Update logic...
    this.emit('cell-changed', { address, oldValue, newValue: value });
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive validation and testing strategies

**Multi-Layer Testing Architecture:**
- **Unit testing** for individual functions and components with Jest
- **Integration testing** for complex dependency chains and edge cases
- **Property-based testing** using fast-check for mathematical property validation
- **Compatibility testing** against Excel and Google Sheets behavior

**Validation Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Schema validation using zod/v4
const CellValueSchema = z.union([
  z.number(),
  z.string(),
  z.boolean(),
  z.date(),
  z.null(),
  z.undefined()
]);

function validateFormulaArgs(args: unknown): Result<FunctionArgs, ValidationError> {
  const result = FunctionArgsSchema.safeParse(args);
  return result.success 
    ? { success: true, data: result.data }
    : { success: false, error: new ValidationError(result.error.message) };
}
```
